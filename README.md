# simulated_annealing
Simulated Annealing algorithm for Traveling Salesman task.

## Data

Data about 30 most populated cities in Russia was considered. The required information is geo coordinates and name of a city.

## Workbench

Following tasks were completed:
1. Explore and prepare data
2. Write Simulated Annealing algorithm with adjustable annealing rate
3. Write plotting algoritm with animation of taking different solutions while running SA
4. Experiment on different values of annealing rate, plot and compare results

## Output files

The description of initial data and results (plots of convergence of algorithms) can be found in report.pdf. 

The code can be found in Jupyter Notebook sim_anneal.ipynb. There are also animations of taking different solutions while running SA.
